TextStyleManager
================

TextStyleManager is a Unity asset to help with managing the fonts that are used throughout a project, and supporting quickly changing all the fonts that are being used at runtime. The initial use case for this project was to make it easy to switch between sets of fonts for use with different languages when implementing localization.
